  <h1>Chapter 8/9 Catcher <b> in the rye summary </h1>
   	<font color="red"><p>Holden walks to the <u>train station to go to New York. </u>When he gets there he meets up with his disliked friend’s mother. Her son’s name is Ernest. He lies about how good Ernest is saying how he should be class president. Holden says he is Rudolph Schmidt. Holden dislikes phonies but he is being one. He is being hypocritical. I would never lie to a mother as that is being disrespectful and they can find out you are lying very easily. When Holden gets to New York he can’t figure out who to call so he decides to have a conversation with the cab driver. I never talk to cab drivers. He asks the cab driver about where the ducks go in the winter. The cab driver wasn’t interested. When he gets to his room he sees bizarre acts. He sees a man dressed as a woman in the other room he sees a couple spitting water at each other. This gets personal with Holden. He wants to make sure they care about each other. He doesn’t want one of them getting hurt. I agree with this. If you are doing this you shouldn’t be cheating on her you should care about her. His rule is don't mess around with her if you don’t care about her. This is a good rule and I completely agree with it.
